# PySpark-Roadmap  
A **structured 18-day PySpark learning roadmap** covering **DataFrames, SQL, Joins, Window Functions, Performance Tuning, and MLlib** with daily datasets and coding tasks.  

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description  
This repository contains my complete journey of learning PySpark through a **daily coding roadmap**.  
Each day focuses on a new PySpark concept with a dataset and implementation example. By the end, the roadmap covers an **end-to-end mini project** and **MLlib model training**.  

---

## âœ¨ Features  
- Beginner to advanced **PySpark concepts** in 18 days.  
- Hands-on coding tasks with datasets for each topic.  
- Covers **DataFrames, SQL, Aggregations, Joins, Window Functions, Performance tuning**.  
- **Mini Project (Day 15):** Data cleaning, joining, aggregations, and saving results.  
- **MLlib tasks (Day 16â€“18):** Feature engineering, decision tree, and ML pipeline.  
- Code is written for **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** for easy execution.
