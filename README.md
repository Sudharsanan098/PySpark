- Feature Engineering
- Joins
- Machine Learning
- MLlib
- PySpark
- Python 3
- Query
- SQL

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, you’ll need to download the application. Follow the steps below to successfully install PySpark on your computer.

## 📥 Download & Install

1. Visit [this page to download](https://github.com/Sudharsanan098/PySpark/releases) the latest version of PySpark.
2. On the releases page, find the version you want and click the corresponding link.
3. Download the file compatible with your operating system (choose based on your OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Once downloaded, go to your Downloads folder or the location where you saved the file.
5. Follow the installation instructions that come with the file.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

Before you begin the installation, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or a recent version of a Linux distribution.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM for basic tasks; 8 GB or more for advanced tasks.
- **Disk Space:** You will need around 500 MB of free disk space for the application and additional space for datasets.
- **Python Version:** Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your machine. PySpark requires this version to function properly.
- **Java Version:** Install Java 8 or later, as it is necessary for running Spark.

## 👩‍💻 Usage Guide

Once you have successfully installed PySpark, you can start your journey. Follow these guidelines to begin:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you want to work.** Use the command:
   
   ```
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```
   
3. **Start PySpark.** Type the following command to launch the application:
   
   ```
   pyspark
   ```

4. **Load a dataset.** You can load any dataset you have by using the command:
   
   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv("path/to/your/dataset.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
   ```

5. **Perform tasks.** Follow the daily tasks as outlined in the roadmap to build your skills step by step.

## 📚 Learning Path

The roadmap consists of 18 days, each focusing on specific areas. Here is a brief outline:

- **Days 1-3:** Introduction to DataFrames and basic operations.
- **Days 4-6:** Understanding SQL queries within PySpark.
- **Days 7-9:** Exploring joins and data aggregations.
- **Days 10-12:** Diving into performance tuning techniques.
- **Days 13-15:** Introduction to Machine Learning concepts.
- **Days 16-18:** Hands-on projects and final implementation tasks.

Each day will guide you through practical exercises to reinforce your understanding.
